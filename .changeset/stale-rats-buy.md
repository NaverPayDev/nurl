ðŸ”§ Fix pathname handling and href generation in NURL class

- Previously, when creating an NURL instance with an explicitly empty string ('') for the pathname, the resulting URL automatically defaulted to a root path ('/'). This behavior was inconsistent with the native JavaScript URL object, which retains an empty pathname as-is, resulting in a URL consisting only of query parameters.

```javascript
// as-is
// Input
const url = new NURL({ pathname: '', query: { test: '1' } });

// Output
url.href === '/?test=1';

// to-be
// Input
const url = new NURL({ pathname: '', query: { test: '1' } });

// Output
url.href === '?test=1';
```

- Previously, assigning an empty string ('') to the pathname property via setter retained the existing pathname. However, to align with the native JavaScript URL objectâ€™s behavior, assigning an empty string now explicitly clears the pathname.

```javascript
// Before 
url.pathname = ''; // pathname remained '/hello'

// After (new default behavior):
url.pathname = ''; // pathname becomes '', resulting in removal of '/hello'
```
